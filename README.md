# PseudoShell
You are asked to write a myshell, which is a very simple shell that replicates some of the basic features of a traditional shell. You shell should be written in C and exists mainly in the file myshell.c, but you are free to add additional source code files as long as your Makefile works, and compiles an executable named myshell.
